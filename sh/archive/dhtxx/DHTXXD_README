REQUIRES

One or more DHT11/DHT21/DHT22/DHT33/DHT44.

TO BUILD

gcc -Wall -pthread -o DHTXXD test_DHTXXD.c DHTXXD.c -lpigpiod_if2

TO RUN

./DHTXXD -g17 # one reading from DHT connected to GPIO 17

./DHTXXD -g14 -i3 # read DHT connected to GPIO 14 every 3 seconds

DHTXXD returns three values.  A status, the temperature, and the
humidity.  The status is one of the following.  0 (good)
indicates a successful read.  The other values indicate a read failure
and the last good read of temperature and humidity will be returned.

#define DHT_GOOD         0
#define DHT_BAD_CHECKSUM 1
#define DHT_BAD_DATA     2
#define DHT_TIMEOUT      3
